# 📊 Probability & Monte Carlo Simulations  

This repository contains projects developed as part of **Probability Theory** coursework. It includes Monte Carlo simulations, statistical analysis, and numerical experiments related to the **Law of Large Numbers**.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- **monte-carlo/pi-estimation.py** – Monte Carlo method for estimating **π**.  
- **monte-carlo/e-estimation.py** – Numerical approximation of **Euler's number (e)** using Monte Carlo.  
- **large-numbers/card-experiment.py** – Probability-based card drawing experiment using the **Law of Large Numbers**.  
- **docs/** – Documentation and theoretical explanations. (🚧 This section is under construction)

## 🛠️ How to Run?  
This repository includes Python scripts for running simulations. To get started:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/helloGrimm/probability-simulations.git
cd large-numbers  # or another experiment folder  
python pi-estimation.py  # or another simulation script
