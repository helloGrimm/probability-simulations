# Monte Carlo & Probability Experiments
This repository contains probability-based computational experiments using Monte Carlo methods and the Law of Large Numbers.

## Overview
This simulation focus on:
- Random number generation and probabilistic analysis
- Estimating mathematical constants (e.g. **e**, **π**) using stochastic methods
- Monte Carlo techniques for solving probabilitiy-realted problems

## Example Simulations
- Generating random numbers between 0 and 1, analyzing thier sum convergences to ~0,854
- Checking if random points fall inside a unit circle to estimate **π**
- Monte Carlo method for approximating Euler's number **e**

## How to run
Clone the repository and execute the scripts to explore numerical probability methods:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/helloGrimm/probability-simulations.git
