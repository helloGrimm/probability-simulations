## Probability & Monte Carlo Simulations  

This repository contains various computational probability experiments, including Monte Carlo simulations, stochastic models, and large number experiments.  

## Structure  

- `monte-carlo/pi-estimation/` → Monte Carlo method for approximating π  
- `monte-carlo/e-estimation/` → Monte Carlo approach to estimate Euler's number (e)  
- `large-numbers/card-experiment/` → Probabilistic analysis of random card draws (Large Numbers-based)   
- `docs/` → Documentation and theoretical explanations  

## How to Get Started  

Clone the repository and navigate to the desired simulation folder:  

```bash
git https://github.com/helloGrimm/probability-simulations.git
cd large-numbers/card-experiment  # or another simulation folder
python pi-estimation.py # or another simulation file
