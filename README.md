# Monte Carlo & Probability Experiments
This repository contains probability-based computational experiments using Monte Carlo methods and the Law of Large Numbers.

## Overview
This simulation focus on:
- Random number generation and probabilistic analysis
- Estimating mathematical constants (e.g. **e**, **π**) using stochastic methods
- Monte Carlo techniques for solving probabilitiy-realted problems

## Example Simulations
- Drawing 4 cards from a 53-card deck and analyzing probability of forming a pair of one color and two distinct others
- Checking if random points fall inside a unit circle to estimate **π**
- Monte Carlo method for approximating Euler's number **e**

## How to run
